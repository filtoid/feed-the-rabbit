# feed-the-rabbit
Originally created for Code Bunnies - a Python/PyGame game for use with Makey Makey

You will need to have the PyGame libraries installed

`pip3 install pygame`

Once downloaded you should just be able to run the main program using the command

`python3 main.py`

Hit the space bar to enable 'Hardcore Mode' which will give you 2 points for every bunny fed but subtract 1 for incorrectly feeding a bunny when it's not popped out of the hole. When it is disabled you get 1 point for every bunny fed but there are no penalties.

There are 5 holes each with a rabbit which will pop out. When the rabbit is out of the hole push left for the first hole, up for the second hole, down for the third hole, right for the fourth hole and space for the last hole.

This project is designed to map the above keys to a Makey Makey so that you can tap a carrot (or other vegetable) to feed the bunny. The controls make a lot more sense when mapped to carrots corresponding to the holes they pop out of.

Please feel free to download this and have a play.
